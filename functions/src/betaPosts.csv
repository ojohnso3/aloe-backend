I’m not anti-porn, but I feel like it can’t be good to give pubescent boys an unrealistic idea of how sex should be. Rarely do porn stars ask for consent in an appropriate way, there’s no way those girls are enjoying it THAT MUCH lol and they’re never wearing rubbers. Food for thought.",Film/TV//Porn,1,0
7,rvmrSMFUbZfjqpE7aSFd,"I am a straight passing white male, who identifies as bisexual. I saw this having had the majority of relationships in my life with women, and only a handful with men — most not very serious. My freshman year of college I started being interested in this boy, who was also interested in me. After winter break we began hooking up but it became clear that we were at different stages in terms of our sexuality. He had been in two serious homosexual relationships and I had never had a relationship that was intimate with a man. I really wanted to be able to explore and communicated this from the get go of the relationship. I wasn’t sure how attracted I was to the male sex, and this was a period of exploration for me. At first the boy seemed to understand, but as we continued seeing each other I felt a looming pressure to progress our relationship sexually. I could tell that my partner was frustrated with how slow I was moving things and moreover by how non-committal I was to the relationship. I saw the relationship as a way to experiment and discover what my true sexual desires were. Growing up in so many heteronormative spaces I felt as though I never took the time to explore that side of me fully. I found that while I was excited about the prospect of uncovering this part of myself, I was more than anything nervous, and so we went almost 2 weeks just hooking up without progressing much otherwise on the sexual front. We spent a lot of time together, and I realized I did like him, but I felt as though there was too much pressure in the relationship to be balancing my interest in someone I liked and my ability to explore in a secure and safe way. I decided that this pressure was not what I wanted in my life and the boy did not take it well at all. I feel sad sometimes because I doubt that I will ever be able to have an opportunity to explore in a way that doesn’t have this pressure.",Sexual Orientation//Hookup Culture//College,1,0
12,rvmrSMFUbZfjqpE7aSFd,"I’d highly recommend first times being with someone you know well and are friends with. This isn’t a hard rule obviously because everyone is different, but this my biggest first-time advice because sex is NOT how it’s shown in movies. It is funny and awkward and there are weird noises! It’s just a lot easier to get through that, laugh, and have a good time when it’s with someone you can readily communicate and joke with.",Sexual Pleasure//Advice,1,0
13,fXocsZzfCYqXPTALqDoS,"One night sophomore year of college, I left a party with a guy to go back to his dorm. I was pretty drunk but I distinctly remember liking him and wanting to leave with him. He lived in a double, but he told me that his roommate wouldn’t be back for an hour. As we were making out on his bed, I became a bit dizzy and kept disassociating from the experience. We continued to undress, which I was okay with, and eventually we were both naked in his bed. At that point, he pulled away and hopped off the bed. He opened the drawer to my right, quickly closed it, and then jumped back on the bed. He then said, “I don’t have any condoms, so we don’t have to have sex tonight.” I nodded and felt a calming sensation run through me, which I later pinpointed to be relief. We finished hooking up, and then I left to walk home before his roommate returned. I woke up the next morning hungover and feeling a bit weird about my experience the night before. I enjoyed hooking up with him, but in hindsight, I realized I was probably too drunk to have sex, and definitely not lucid enough to give any real indication of consent. Even a year later, I still wonder what would have happened if he did have condoms that night.",Hookup Culture//Alcohol//College,1,0
14,rvmrSMFUbZfjqpE7aSFd,Idk why this isn’t a thing in sex ed in HS...why don’t schools teach us that peeing after sex is a MUST. Definitely a major sexual health tip that I wish I learned earlier.,Hygiene//High School,1,0
15,rvmrSMFUbZfjqpE7aSFd,"During my freshman year of college, I downloaded the notorious gay hookup app Grindr. There weren’t any gay guys at my high school, so this was my first real opportunity to experiment with other guys. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I was kind of just looking to meet other guys my age and casually experiment. However, I was met with a series of unsolicited dick pics, men in their fifties offering money and to meet me at my dorm room, and very specific questions about my kinks, stats, and preferences that I didn’t have the answers to. I was super overwhelmed, but it didn’t feel like I had many other options. One night, when I was feeling really insecure and lonely, I almost met up with a faceless guy many years older than me, something that I was absolutely not prepared for. As many gay guys know, Grindr is often the site of grooming and predation of young (sometimes underage) boys by men much older than them. It just sucks because sometimes it feels like that’s the only option. I often feel like I have to walk the line between having traumatic sexual experiences and closing myself off to sexual relationships entirely.",Dating Apps//Sexual Orientation,1,0
16,RatkApgPLlbK1f9g3Oio,"So I made these coupons for my girlfriend for her birthday. One of them was, “let’s try a new sex position”. Naturally, we googled sex positions to try. I think we ended up trying “the pretzel dip” or the “snow angel” lol. These positions were so damn weird it felt like we forgot how to apply the basic concept of putting a dick in a vagina. Rather than fucking like we usually do, it put us both out of our comfort zone. But we both were communicating, and we felt safe together. Long story short, sex is great when both parties are awkward.",Sexual Pleasure//Relationships,1,0
